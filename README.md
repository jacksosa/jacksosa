👋 Hi, I’m Samuel Jackson, a Senior Back End Developer with 20+ years of experience designing high-performance, resilient software across finance, energy, retail, and betting industries.

🛠️ My expertise lies in Java & Spring Boot, but I also work with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, and modern cloud-native architectures on AWS. I'm passionate about Test-Driven Development, CI/CD, and crafting scalable APIs and event-driven systems.

🚀 I’ve built:
* A real-time, serverless financial data ingestion platform on AWS
* Smart metering orchestration systems ensuring reliable energy data exchange
* An automated, event-driven trading framework integrated with Betfair’s Exchange & Streaming APIs

⚙️ My tech toolbox includes:
`Java`, `Spring Boot`, `Python`, `AWS`, `GitHub Actions`, `SQL`, `Docker`, `CloudFormation`, `Ansible`, `Apache Druid`, and much more...

🏁 Off the keyboard, I’m a **4th Dan Tae Kwon Do Master**, competitive cyclist, and former marathon fundraiser — always pushing boundaries in work and life.
